## 🚀 Ready for GitHub

Once all items are checked:

1. **Initialize Git Repository**
   ```bash

   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

3. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Set Up Branch Protection**
   - Protect main branch
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Enable status checks

5. **Configure Deployment**
   - Set up Vercel for frontend
