## üöÄ Ready for GitHub

Once all items are checked:

1. **Initialize Git Repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Moroz Art Gallery application"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

3. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Set Up Branch Protection**
   - Protect main branch
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Enable status checks

5. **Configure Deployment**
   - Set up Vercel for frontend
   - Set up Firebase Functions deployment
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up webhooks
