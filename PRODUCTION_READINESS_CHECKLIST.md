## ‚ö†Ô∏è Items Requiring Action for Production

### Environment Variables
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Replace test Stripe keys with live production keys
  - Current: `pk_test_51RrxjBJHHLWU5Kg3...` (test key)
  - Need: `pk_live_...` (live key)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Update Firebase Functions URL for production
  - Current: `http://127.0.0.1:5001/demo-test/us-central1` (local emulator)
  - Need: `https://us-central1-your-project-id.cloudfunctions.net`
- [ ] Configure Firebase Functions environment variables:
  ```bash
  firebase functions:config:set stripe.secret_key="sk_live_your_live_key_here"
  firebase functions:config:set stripe.webhook_secret="whsec_your_webhook_secret_here"
  ```

### Stripe Configuration
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Set up production Stripe webhooks
  - Endpoint: `https://us-central1-your-project-id.cloudfunctions.net/stripeWebhookV2`
  - Events: checkout.session.completed, payment_intent.succeeded
- [ ] Update Stripe Connect settings for production
- [ ] Verify platform fee calculations are correct for production

### Deployment Configuration
- [ ] Choose deployment platform (Vercel recommended for frontend)
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Set up SSL/HTTPS (automatic with Vercel)
- [ ] Update CORS settings in Firebase Functions for production domain

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Review and tighten storage rules (currently allows unrestricted writes)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on Firebase Functions
- [ ] Set up monitoring and error tracking
- [ ] Configure backup strategy

### Testing
- [ ] Test complete purchase flow with live Stripe keys in staging
- [ ] Verify email notifications work in production
- [ ] Test admin functionality in production environment
- [ ] Verify shipping calculations with real rates

## üö® Critical Security Issues to Address

1. **Storage Rules Too Permissive**: Current rules allow anyone to upload images
   - Recommendation: Restrict to authenticated admin users only

2. **Test Keys in Production**: Currently using Stripe test keys
   - Must replace with live keys before going live

3. **Local Development URLs**: Frontend pointing to local emulator
   - Must update to production Firebase Functions URL

## Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Update .env for production
   REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_live_key_here
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_FUNCTIONS_URL=https://us-central1-your-project-id.cloudfunctions.net
   ```

2. **Deploy Firebase Functions**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

3. **Deploy Frontend** (Vercel):
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Configure environment variables
   - Deploy automatically

4. **Post-Deployment**:
   - Configure Stripe webhooks
   - Test complete flow
   - Monitor for errors

## Current Status: üü° READY FOR STAGING

The application is **NOT ready for production** due to:
- Test Stripe keys being used
- Local development URLs in configuration
- Storage security rules need tightening

However, it **IS ready for staging deployment** to test the production flow with test keys.
